/// This trait combines several standard library traits (`Any`, `Send`, `Sync`, `Debug`)
/// with [`DynClone`] to ensure that messages are safe to send between threads,
/// can be dynamically cloned (even as trait objects), support downcasting back to
/// their concrete types, and are debuggable.
///
/// The `as_any` and `as_any_mut` methods are crucial for the framework's ability
/// to handle messages generically and perform type-based dispatch (e.g., in message
/// handlers registered via [`ManagedAgent::act_on`](crate::actor::ManagedAgent::act_on)).
///
/// A blanket implementation is provided, so any type `T` that satisfies the bounds
/// (`T: Any + Send + Sync + Debug + DynClone + 'static`) automatically implements
/// `ActonMessage`. Users typically only need to ensure their message structs/enums
/// derive `Clone` and `Debug` and meet the `Send + Sync + 'static` requirements.
