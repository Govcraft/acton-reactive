/// A clonable handle for interacting with an agent.
///
/// `AgentHandle` provides the primary mechanism for communicating with and managing
/// an agent from outside its own execution context. It encapsulates the necessary
/// information to send messages to the agent's inbox (`outbox`), identify the agent (`id`),
/// manage its lifecycle (`stop`), track its tasks (`tracker`), and navigate the
/// supervision hierarchy (`parent`, `children`, `supervise`).
///
/// Handles can be cloned freely, allowing multiple parts of the system to hold references
/// to the same agent. Sending messages through the handle is asynchronous.
///
/// Key functionalities are exposed through implemented traits:
/// *   [`AgentHandleInterface`]: Core methods for interaction (sending messages, stopping, etc.).
/// *   [`Broker`]: Methods for broadcasting messages via the system broker.
/// *   [`Subscriber`]: Method for accessing the system broker handle.
///
/// Equality and hashing are based solely on the agent's unique identifier (`id`).
