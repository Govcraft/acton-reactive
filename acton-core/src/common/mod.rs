//! Contains common types, utilities, and core components used throughout the Acton framework.
//!
//! This module aggregates fundamental building blocks such as:
//! - System initialization (`ActonApp`) and runtime management (`AgentRuntime`).
//! - Agent interaction handles (`AgentHandle`) and the message broker (`AgentBroker`).
//! - Utility types for message handling (`AgentReply`) and internal type definitions (`types`).
