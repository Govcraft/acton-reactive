//! Defines core message types, addressing, and signaling mechanisms for the Acton framework.
//!
//! This module includes fundamental structures for:
//! - Representing agent addresses ([`MessageAddress`]).
//! - Wrapping messages for sending ([`OutboundEnvelope`]).
//! - Handling broker interactions ([`BrokerRequest`], [`BrokerRequestEnvelope`]).
//! - System-level signals ([`SystemSignal`]).
